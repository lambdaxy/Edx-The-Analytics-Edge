TODO

* Try using mice differently (my inputing does not improve much)
* Check how many rows are complete
* Clustering then predict based on clusters?
* run mice on combined test and train? Seems that Gender imputation could improve results but not imputation over all demographic variables...
* I should inpute those YOB NA in training instead of removing them since I will inpute them in the submission set. (outliers can still be removed)
* try glmnet
*try script data preparation downloaded
