TODO

* Try imputting missing values with mice.
* Check how many rows are complete
* Clustering then predict based on clusters?
* replace YOB outliers with NA before inputing with mice
* run mice on combined test and train? Seems that Gender imputation could improve results but not imputation over all demographic variables...
